The Lex Machina API is in General Availability release!
This release now includes state court data. In order to create endpoints and schemas that have some consistency across district and state data, refactoring was necessary. For those who are directly implementing access to our API, this will require some changes to code. There is a guide to the changes in the developer portal at https://developer.</description></item></channel></rss>
